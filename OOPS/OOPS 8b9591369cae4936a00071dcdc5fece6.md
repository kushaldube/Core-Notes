# OOPS

### What is Object Oriented Programming

- Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
- It is basically a computer programming design philosophy or methodology that organizes/ models software design around data, or objects rather than functions and logic.
- It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing major concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

### Benefits Of OOPS

- Modular, scalable, extensible, reusable, and maintainable.
- It models the complex problem in a simple structure.
- Objects can be used across the program.
- Code can be reused.
- We can easily modify, and append code without affecting the other code blocs.
- Provides security through encapsulation and data-hiding features.
- Beneficial to collaborative development in which a large project is divided into groups.
- Debugging is easy.

### Limitations of OOPS

- Requires intensive testing processes.
- Solving problems takes more time as compared to Procedure Oriented Programming.
- The size of the programs created using this approach may become larger than the programs written using the procedure-oriented programming approach.
- Software developed using this approach requires a substantial amount of pre-work and planning.
- OOP code is difficult to understand if you do not have the corresponding class documentation.
- In certain scenarios, these programs can consume a large amount of memory.
- Not suitable for small problems.
- Takes more time to solve problems.

## Classes

<aside>
💡 Classes are named groups of properties and functions. They have Functions (behaviors)  and Attributes (properties)

or

A class is a blueprint that defines the variables and the methods common to all objects of a certain kind. It helps us to bind data and methods together, making the code reusable, unlike procedural language.

</aside>

A class is a user-defined layout or blueprint of an object that describes what a specific kind of object will look like.

A class description consists of two things:

- Attributes or member variables
- Implementations of behavior or member functions.

******Syntax:******

```java
class <class_name>{  
    field;  
    method;  
  }
```

## Objects

<aside>
💡 Objects are entities in the real world.
An object is a single instance of a class, which contains data and methods working on that data.

</aside>

An object consists of three things:

- Name: This is a variable name that represents the object.
- Member data: The data that describes the object.
- Member methods: Behavior that describes the object.

**************Syntax:**************

```java
ClassName ReferenceVariable = new ClassName();
```

### Class vs Object

| No. | Object | Class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1) | An object is an instance of a class. | Class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created. |
| 2) | An object is a real-world entity such as a pen, laptop, mobile, bed, keyboard, mouse, chair, etc. | Class is a group of similar objects. |
| 3) | An object is a physical entity. | Class is a logical entity. |
| 4) | An object is created through new keyword mainly e.g.Student s1=new Student(); | Class is declared using class keyword e.g.class Student{} |
| 5) | An object is created many times as per requirement. | Class is declared once. |
| 6) | Object allocates memory when it is created. | Class doesn't allocate memory when it is created. |
| 7) | There are many ways to create an object in Java such as new keyword, newInstance() method, clone() method, factory method, and deserialization. | There is only one way to define a class in Java using the class keyword. |

## Object Class

The Object class is the parent class of all the classes in java by default

******************Object Methods:******************

- hashcode(): it gives a number representation of an object
- equals(): compares two objects (’==’ check if it points to the same location, whereas equals check if the values are same or not)
- instanceOf(): to check if the object is a instance of the specified class.
- getClass():

## Singleton Class

Singleton is a design pattern that ensures that a class can only have one object at a time.

To create a singleton class, a class must implement the following properties:

- Create a `private` constructor of the class to restrict object creation outside of the class.
- Create a `private` attribute of the class type that refers to a single object.
- Create a `public static` method that allows us to create and access the object we created. Inside the method, we will create a condition that restricts us from creating more than one object.

Singletons can be used while working with databases. They can be used to create a connection pool to access the database while reusing the same connection for all the clients but restrict the limit of the number of object creations to only one..

# Inner Classes (To-Do h2)

## Packages in Java

A package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces, and sub-interfaces.

We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories:

- Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
    
    The Java API is a library of prewritten classes, that are free to use, included in the Java Development Environment. e.g. java.lang, java.io, , java.util, java.applet, java.awt, java.net
    
    - some built-in package
        - lang: This contains the essential language specific stuff of java. It is automatically imported
        - io: This contains the input output classes
        - util: This contains the utility classes
        - applet:
        - awt:
        - net:
- User-defined Packages (create your own packages)
    
    To create your own package, you need to understand that Java uses a file system directory to store them. Just like folders on your computer:
    
    e.g.
    
    ```
    └── root
      └── mypack
        └── MyPackageClass.java
    ```
    

## Access Modifiers

<aside>
💡 The access modifiers in Java specify the accessibility or scope of a field, method, constructor, or class. We can change the access level of fields, constructors, methods, and classes by applying the access modifier to it.

</aside>

They are used to implement data hiding.

There are four types of Java access modifiers:

1. **Private**: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.
2. **Default**: The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If you do not specify any access level, it will be the default.
3. **Protected**: The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through the child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.
4. **Public**: The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package, and outside the package.

Modifiers can be used

| Access Modifier | within class | within package | within package
by subclass | outside package by subclass only | outside package
without subclass |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y |
| Protected | Y | Y | Y | Y | N |
| Default | Y | Y | Y | N | N |
| Private | Y | N | N | N | N |

### Getters and Setters

These functions are created with functions to perform get and set functions for private data

‘this’ keyword: this keyword is used to refer to the current object. i.e. the object which the function calls and wants to be referenced.

```java
class example{
    int value;

    void setValue(int val) {
        this.value = val;
    }

    int getValue() {
        return this.value;
    }
}
```

## Member function (To-Do)

### Inside class function

### Outside class function

## Constructor

<aside>
💡 Constructor is a special method that is invoked automatically at the time of object creation.
It is used to initialize objects.

</aside>

Constructor in java is used to create the instance of the class. Constructors are almost similar to methods except for two things - its name is the same as the class name and it has no return type. Sometimes constructors are also referred to as special methods to initialize an object.

```java
class Test {
  Test() {
    // constructor body
  }
}
```

```java
class example{
    int value1;
    int value2;

    void example(int val1, int val2) {
        this.value1 = val1;
				this.value2 = val2;
    }
}
```

**Properties:**

- Constructors have the same name as class or structure
- Constructors don’t have a return type. (Not even void)
- Constructors are only called once, at creation.
- Memory allocation happens when the constructor is called.

**Types of Constructors:**

- No-Arg Constructor
    
    If a constructor does not accept any parameters, it is known as a no-argument constructor.
    
- Non- Parameterized / Default Constructor:
    
    The constructor which does not have any arguments i.e. no value is being passed in the function.
    
    It is invoked at the time of creating an object.
    
    A default constructor is a constructor that is automatically generated by the compiler if no constructor is explicitly defined in a class.
    
    If we do not create any constructor, the Java compiler automatically create a no-arg constructor during the execution of the program. This constructor is called default constructor.
    
- Parameterized Constructor:
    
    A constructor which has parameters is called a parameterized constructor. A Java constructor can also accept one or more parameters. The parameterized constructor is used to provide different values to distinct objects. However, you can provide the same values also.
    
- Copy Constructor:
    
    A Copy constructor is an overloaded constructor used to declare and initialize an object from another object, i.e. it is used to copy properties of one object to some other object.
    
    It is of two types - default copy constructor and user-defined copy constructor.
    
    It is not present by default in Java.
    
    **Shallow and deep copy:** 
    
    Shallow copy: We only copy the references and do not copy the value itself. Changes in original object values reflect in the copied object.
    
    Deep copy: We create new data and changes in original objects do not reflect in the copied object.
    
    Lazy Copy: (Not asked in interviews)
    

**Constructor Overloading:** 

‘**this’ pointer:** 

It is a keyword that refers to the current instance of the class. There can be 3 main uses of the ‘this’ keyword:

1. It can be used to pass the current object as a parameter to another method
2. It can be used to refer to the current class instance variable.
3. It can be used to declare indexers.

- `*Code for implementing constructors: ⬇️*`
    
    ```java
    public class oops{
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            example e1 = new example(); // Non-Parameterised Constructor
            example e2 = new example(10); // Parameterised Constructor
            example e3 = new example(10, 20); // Parameterised Constructor
            example e4 = new example(e1); // Copy Constructor
        }
    }
    
    class example{
        int value1;
        int value2;
        
        example() {
            System.out.println("Constructor is called...");
        }
        
        example(int val) {
            this.value1 = val;
        }
        
        example(int val1, int val2) { // multiple parameters
            this.value1 = val1;
            this.value2 = val2;
        }
    
        example(example e1) { // object as a parameter
            this.value1 = e1.value1;
        } //In this only given values will be copied to the object, others will be with their default values.
    }
    ```
    

**Destructors:**

A destructor works opposite to a constructor; it destructs the objects of classes. It can be defined only once in a class. Like constructors, it is invoked automatically. A destructor is defined like a constructor. It must have the same name as the class, prefixed with a tilde sign (~).

Java has a garbage collector, the unused memory like datatypes, variables, arrays, etc, is deleted by it.

# Important Keywords

- static
    
    <aside>
    💡 Static keyword in Java is used to share the same variable or method of a given class.
    
    </aside>
    
    The value to remain constant or the same is defined using the Static keyword.
    
    We can declare Properties, Functions, Blocks, and Nested Classes as Static.
    
    If a change is made by any object in the static value, it will be affected in all the objects of that class.
    
    You cannot use ‘this’ keyword inside a static function
    
- virtual
    
    The virtual keyword is used to modify a method, property, indexer, or event declaration and allow for it to be overridden in a derived class. For example, this method can be overridden by any class that inherits it: C# Copy. public virtual double Area() { return x * y; }
    
    Not in java
    
- abstract
    
    The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods.
    
    'abstract' keyword is used to declare the method or a class as abstract.
    
    Class: An abstract class is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
    
    Method: An abstract method can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body.
    
- final
    
    The `final` keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override).
    
    The `final` keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, like PI (3.14159...).
    
    The `final` keyword is called a "modifier". 
    
- explicit
    
    Explicit Keyword in C++ is used to mark constructors to not implicitly convert types in C++. It is optional for constructors that take exactly one argument and work on constructors(with a single argument) since those are the only constructors that can be used in typecasting.
    
- this
    
    It is a keyword that refers to the current instance of the class. There can be 3 main uses of the ‘this’ keyword:
    
    1. It can be used to pass the current object as a parameter to another method
    2. It can be used to refer to the current class instance variable.
    3. It can be used to declare indexers.
- new
    
    The `new` keyword in OOP is used to create an instance of a class. It dynamically allocates memory for the object and returns a reference to the object. The general syntax is:
    
    ```java
    ClassName ReferenceVariable = new ClassName();
    
    ```
    
    Here, `ClassName` is the name of the class you want to create an instance of, `ReferenceVariable` is the name of the variable that will reference the new object, and `new` is the keyword used to allocate memory for the object.
    
    For example, to create a new instance of the `Dog` class, you would use the following code:
    
    ```java
    Dog myDog = new Dog();
    
    ```
    
    This allocates memory for a new `Dog` object and assigns a reference to it to the `myDog` variable.
    
- const
    
    Whenever const keyword is attached with any method(), variable, pointer variable, and with the object of a class it prevents that specific object/method()/variable to modify its data items value.
    
    This only works in C++ and not in java, the final keyword is used instead as it has no function in java collections.
    
- super
    
    To call the constructor of its immediate parent class.
    
    <aside>
    💡 Super keyword is used to refer to the immediate parent’s class object.
    
    </aside>
    
    It is used to:
    
    - to access parent’s properties
    - to access parent’s functions
    - to access the parent’s constructor
    
    It can also be used as ‘this’ keyword but can only access the immediate parent class.

# Polymorphism

<aside>
💡 Poly - many + morph - forms

</aside>

<aside>
💡 Polymorphism is the ability for a message or data to be processed in more than one form.

</aside>

- **Compile Time Polymorphism (Static) - Function Overloading**
    
    Method Overloading: Multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.
    
    <aside>
    💡 Method overloading is a technique that allows you to have more than one function with the same function name but with different functionality.
    
    </aside>
    
    Method overloading can be possible on the
    
    following basis:
    
    1. The return type of the overloaded function.
    
    2. The type of parameters passed to the function.
    
    3. The number of parameters passed to the function.
    
    ```java
    public class Main{
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Calculator calc = new Calculator();
            System.out.println(calc.sum(1, 2));
            System.out.println(calc.sum((float)1.5, (float)2.5));
            System.out.println(calc.sum(2, 4, 6));
        }
    }
    
    class Calculator{
        int sum(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    
        float sum(float a, float b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    
        int sum(int a, int b, int c) {
            return a + b + c;
        }
    }
    ```
    
    ```java
    public class Main{
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Calculator calc = new Calculator();
            System.out.println(calc.sum(1, 2));
            System.out.println(calc.sum((float)1.5, (float)2.5));
            System.out.println(calc.sum(2, 4, 6));
        }
    }
    
    class Example{
        void something(float a, int b) {
        }
    
        void something(int a, float b) {
        }
    }
    ```
    
- **Run Time Polymorphism (Dynamic) - Function Overriding**
    
    Method Overriding: Parent and Child classes both contain the same function with different definitions.
    
    Function overriding means when the child class contains the method which is already present in the parent class. Hence, the child class overrides the method of the parent class, and the value of the child class’s function is considered. In the case of function overriding, parent and child classes both contain the same function with a different definition.
    
    ```java
    public class oops{
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Sheep s = new Sheep();
            s.eat();
        }
    }
    
    class Animal{
        void eat() {
            System.out.println("Eats anything");
        }
    }
    
    class Sheep extends Animal{
        void eats() {
            System.out.println("Grass");
        }
    }
    ```
    

### Typecasting

A process of converting one data type to another is known as **Typecasting** and **Upcasting** and **Downcasting** is the type of object typecasting.

- **Upcasting** is a type of object typecasting in which a **child object** is typecasted to a **parent class object**. By using the Upcasting, we can easily access the variables and methods of the parent class to the child class.
    
    ```java
    Parent obj = new Child();
    ```
    
    ![Untitled](OOPS%208b9591369cae4936a00071dcdc5fece6/Untitled%201.png)
    
- **Downcasting** is another type of object typecasting. In Downcasting, we assign a parent class reference object to the child class.
    
    ```java
    Parent p1 = new Child();
    Child c1 = (Child)p1;
    ```

### Virtual Function

<aside>
💡 A virtual function or virtual method in an OOP language is a function or method used to override the behavior of the function in an inherited class with the same signature to achieve the polymorphism.

### Derived Class

Can Virtual Function be set to “Private”?

### Inline Virtual Function

### Abstract Class

# Inheritance

<aside>
💡 Inheritance is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent object automatically. In such a way, you can reuse, extend or modify the attributes and behaviors which are defined in other classes.

</aside>

<aside>
💡 Inheritance is when properties & methods of the base class are passed on to a derived class.

</aside>

Sub-Class:

Super-Class:

Reusability:

‘extends’ keyword: **extends** is the keyword used to inherit the properties of a class. Following is the syntax of extends keyword.

```java
class Super {
   // code
}
class Sub extends Super {
   //code
}
```

**Code for Inheritance:**

```java
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog tommy = new Dog();
        tommy.move();
    }
}

// base class
class Animal{
    String color;

    void move() {
        System.out.println("Moves");
    }

    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eats");
    }
}

// derived class
class Dog extends Animal{
    int legs;

    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barks");
    }
}
```

### Types of Inheritance:

- Single-Level Inheritance: When one class inherits another class, it is known as single-level inheritance
- Multi-Level Inheritance:  Multilevel inheritance is a process of deriving a class from another derived class.
- Hierarchical Inheritance: Hierarchical inheritance is defined as the process of deriving more than one class from a base class.
- Hybrid Inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of simple, multiple inheritance and hierarchical inheritance. Not supported in java.
- Multiple Inheritance: Multiple inheritance is the process of deriving a new class that inherits the attributes from two or more classes. Not supported in Java. (Example to be done using interface.)

# Encapsulation

<aside>
💡 Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data and methods under a single unit. It also implements data hiding.

</aside>

# Abstraction

<aside>
💡 Hiding all the unnecessary details and showing only the important parts to the user.

</aside>

### **Abstract Classes:**

- **Abstract class:** is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
- **Abstract method:** can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).

Properties:

- We cannot create an instance(object) of an abstract class
- They can have abstract/non-abstract methods
- They can have constructors
- abstract static methods cannot be overridden and hence cannot be created but you can create static methods inside a abstract class.
- abstract classes needs to be extended so that their methods can be overridden
- 

```java
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Horse h = new Horse();
        h.eat();
        h.walk();
        h.changeColor();
        System.out.println(h.color);
        Chicken  c = new Chicken();
        c.eat();
        c.walk();
        System.out.println(c.color);
    }
}

abstract class Animal{ // Base Class
    String color;

    Animal() { //constructor in a abstract class
        color = "white";
    }

    void eat() { // Non-abstract method
        System.out.println("Animal Eats");
    }

    abstract void walk(); // Abstract method
}

class Horse extends Animal{ // Child Class
    void changeColor() {
        color = "Dark Brown";
    }
    void walk() { // this is necessary as walk is abstract in Animal class
        System.out.println("Horse walks on 4 legs");
    }
}

class Chicken extends Animal{ // Child Class
    void changeColor() {
        color = "Maroon";
    }
    void walk() { // this is necessary as walk is abstract in Animal class
        System.out.println("Horse walks on 2 legs");
    }
}
```

**Data binding :** Data binding is a process of binding the application UI and business logic. Any change made in the business logic will reflect directly to the application UI.

## Interfaces

<aside>
💡 Interface is a blueprint of a class

</aside>

we use ‘implements’ to implement interfaces

Interfaces contain abstract functions.

You can create separate classes in the same interface to tackle function calling with the same name but different use.

Properties:

- All methods are public, abstract and without implementation
- It is used to achieve total abstraction
- Variables in interface are final, public and static.
- It helps to implement Multiple inheritance in java.

```java
public class oops{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Queen q = new Queen();
        q.moves();
    }
}

interface ChessPlayer{ //interface creation
    void moves(); //abstract method
}

class Queen implements ChessPlayer { // absstaction using interface
    public void moves() { // declaration for abstract method for particular class
        System.out.println("up, down, left, right, diagonal (in all 4 directions)");
    }
}

class Rook implements ChessPlayer {
    public void moves() { // public keyword as if no keyword is given, it will be of default type and not same as interface class
        System.out.println("up, down, left, right");
    }
}
class King implements ChessPlayer {
    public void moves() {
        System.out.println("up, down, left, right, diagonal (only 1 step)");
    }
}
```

### Annotations

Annotations are used to provide supplemental information about a program.

- Annotations start with ‘**@**’.
- Annotations do not change the action of a compiled program.
- Annotations help to associate *metadata* (information) to the program elements i.e. instance variables, constructors, methods, classes, etc.
- Annotations are not pure comments as they can change the way a program is treated by the compiler. See below code for example.
- Annotations basically are used to provide additional information, so could be an alternative to XML and Java marker interfaces.

### Generics

**Generics** means **parameterized types**. The idea is to allow type (Integer, String, … etc., and user-defined types) to be a parameter to methods, classes, and interfaces. Using Generics, it is possible to create classes that work with different data types. An entity such as class, interface, or method that operates on a parameterized type is a generic entity.

### Wildcards

The **question mark (?)** is known as the **wildcard** in generic programming. It represents an unknown type. The wildcard can be used in a variety of situations such as the type of a parameter, field, or local variable; sometimes as a return type. Unlike arrays, different instantiations of a generic type are not compatible with each other, not even explicitly. This incompatibility may be softened by the wildcard if ? is used as an actual type parameter.

Wildcards can be used in three ways −

- **Upper bound Wildcard** − ? extends Type.
- **Lower bound Wildcard** − ? super Type.
- **Unbounded Wildcard** − ?

### Lambda Function

A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.

Lambda Expressions implement the only abstract function and therefore implement functional interfaces and provide the below functionalities.

- Enable to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data.
- A function that can be created without belonging to any class.
- A lambda expression can be passed around as if it was an object and executed on demand.

### Constructor Chaining (To-Do)

# Exception Handling

Error vs Exception

Errors occur at compile time and run time, which can terminate the compilation or execution. Exceptions occur only at run time, just that checked exceptions can be detected at compile time.

# Collections Framework

A collection is an object that represents a group of objects (such as the classic Vector class). A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections, enabling collections to be manipulated independently of implementation details.

Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

Functions in Java Collections Framework:

- size(): Find the number of elements
- add(): Add objects to collection.
- remove(): Remove a selected object
- isEmpty(): Returns true if collection is empty
- contains(): Returns true is a particular value is present
- containsAll(): Returns true if all values are present
- clear(): Removes all elements from the collection
- iterator(): Return an iterator over collection
- toArray(): Returns elements in array format
- retainAll(): Retains elements in the collection
- max(): Return max value in the collection
- stream(): Return Sequential elements
- hashcode(): Returns Hashcode of the elements
- spliterator(): Creates splietarator over the elements in the collection

## Enums in java

**Enumerations or Java Enum** serve the purpose of representing a group of named constants in a programming language. Java Enums are used when we know all possible values at compile time, such as choices on a menu, rounding modes, command-line flags, etc. The set of constants in an enum type doesn’t need to stay fixed for all time.

An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).

There are certain properties followed by Enum as mentioned below:

- Every enum is internally implemented by using Class.
- Every enum constant represents an **object** of type enum.
- Enum type can be passed as an argument to **switch** statements.
- Every enum constant is always implicitly **public static final**. Since it is **static**, we can access it by using the enum Name. Since it is **final**, we can’t create child enums.
- We can declare the **main() method** inside the enum. Hence we can invoke the enum directly from the Command Prompt.

```java
// ENUM inside a class
public class Main {
  enum Level {
    LOW,
    MEDIUM,
    HIGH
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM; 
    System.out.println(myVar);

		// Loop through a ENUM
		for (Level myVar : Level.values()) {
		  System.out.println(myVar);
		}
  }
}
```

```java
// ENUM inside a switch statement
enum Level {
  LOW,
  MEDIUM,
  HIGH
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM;

    switch(myVar) {
      case LOW:
        System.out.println("Low level");
        break;
      case MEDIUM:
         System.out.println("Medium level");
        break;
      case HIGH:
        System.out.println("High level");
        break;
    }
  }
}
```
