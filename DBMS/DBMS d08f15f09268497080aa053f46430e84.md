# DBMS

ER model stands for an Entity-Relationship model. It is a high-level data model. This model is used to define the data elements and relationships for a specified system.
It develops a conceptual design for the database. It also develops a very simple and easy-to-design view of data.
In ER modeling, the database structure is portrayed as a diagram called an entity-relationship diagram.

The¬†`abstract`¬†keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:

- **Abstract class:**¬†is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
- **Abstract method:**¬†can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).

The highest level of abstraction aims to simplify users‚Äô interaction with the system by providing different views to different end-user.

Each view schema describes the database part that a particular user group is interested and hides the remaining database from that user group.

At the external level, a database contains several schemas that sometimes called as subschema. The subschema is used to describe the different view of the database.

At views also provide a security mechanism to prevent users from accessing certain parts

### What is Data?

Data is a collection of raw, unorganized facts and details like text, observations, figures, symbols, and descriptions of things etc.

In other words, data does not carry any specific purpose and has no significance by itself.

Moreover, data is measured in terms of bits and bytes ‚Äì which are basic units of information in the context of computer storage and processing.

Data can be recorded and doesn‚Äôt have any meaning unless processed.

### Types of Data

- Quantitative
    - Numerical form
    - Weight, volume, and cost of an item.
- b. Qualitative
    - Descriptive, but not numerical.
    - Name, gender, and hair color of a person.

### What is Information?

Information is the processed, organized, and structured data.

It provides context for the data and enables decision-making.

Processed data that make sense to us.

Information is extracted from the data, by analyzing and interpreting pieces of data.

E.g., you have data on all the people living in your locality, its Data, when you analyze and interpret the data and come to some conclusion that:

1. There are 100 senior citizens.
2. The sex ratio is 1.1.
3. Newborn babies are 100.
    
    These are information.
    

### Data vs Information

a. Data is a collection of facts, while information puts those facts into context.

b. While data is raw and unorganized, information is organized.

c. Data points are individual and sometimes unrelated. Information maps out that data to provide a big-picture view of how it all fits together.

d. Data, on its own, is meaningless. When it‚Äôs analyzed and interpreted, it becomes meaningful information.

e. Data does not depend on information; however, information depends on data.

f. Data typically comes in the form of graphs, numbers, figures, or statistics. Information is typically presented through words, language, thoughts, and ideas.

g. Data isn‚Äôt sufficient for decision-making, but you can make decisions based on information.

### What is a Database?

a. Database is an electronic place/system where data is stored in a way that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

b. To make real use of Data, we need Database management systems. (DBMS)

### What is DBMS?

a. A database-management system (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access those data. The collection of data, usually referred to as the database,
contains information relevant to an enterprise. The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is both convenient and efficient.

b. A DBMS is the database itself, along with all the software and functionality. It is used to perform different operations, like addition, access, updating, and deletion of the data.

### DBMS vs File Systems

File-processing systems have major disadvantages.

1. Data Redundancy and inconsistency
    
    (Definitions)
    
2. Difficulty in accessing data
3. Data isolation
4. Integrity problems
5. Atomicity problems
6. Concurrent-access anomalies
7. Security problems

The above 7 are also the Advantages of DBMS (answer to ‚ÄúWhy to use DBMS?‚Äù)

### Abstraction

<aside>
üí° Abstraction in Java is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user and showing only the functionality to the user. It can be achieved by using abstract classes, methods, and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be inherited by concrete classes.
It is used to hide the underlying complexity

</aside>

The¬†*abstract* keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:

- **Abstract class:**¬†is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
- **Abstract method:**¬†can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).

## Three Schema Architecture 
(Three Levels of Abstraction in DBMS)

The major purpose of DBMS is to provide users with an abstract view of the data. That is, the system hides certain details of how the data is stored and maintained.

To simplify user interaction with the system, abstraction is applied through several levels of abstraction.

The main objective of three-level architecture is to enable multiple users to access the same data with a personalized view while storing the underlying data only once

1. **Physical level / Internal level**
    1. The lowest level of abstraction describes how the data are stored.
    2. Low-level data structures were used.
    3. It has a Physical schema that describes the physical storage structure of DB.
    4. Talks about: Storage allocation (N-ary tree etc), Data compression & encryption, etc.
    5. Goal: We must define algorithms that allow efficient access to data.
2. **Logical level / Conceptual level:**
    1. The conceptual schema describes the design of a database at the conceptual level, describes what data are stored in DB, and what relationships exist among those data.
    2. The user at the logical level does not need to be aware about physical-level structures.
    3. DBA, who must decide what information to keep in the DB uses the logical level of abstraction.
    4. Goal: easy to use
3. **View level / External level:**
    1. The highest level of abstraction aims to simplify users‚Äô interaction with the system by providing different views to different end-user.
    2. Each view schema describes the database part that a particular user group is interested in and hides the remaining database from that user group.
    3. At the external level, a database contains several schemas that are sometimes called subschema. The subschema is used to describe the different views of the database.
    4. At views also provide a security mechanism to prevent users from accessing certain parts of the database.

### Instance

The collection of information stored in the DB at a particular moment is called an instance of DB. One can easily change these instances using certain CRUD operations, such as deletion and addition of data and information.

### Schema

It refers to an overall design or description that we get for any given database. In simpler words, schema refers to the basic structure of how one needs to store data in any database. 

A schema is a structural description of data. The schema doesn‚Äôt change frequently. Data may change frequently.

DB schema corresponds to the variable declarations (along with type) in a program.

We have 3 types of Schemas: Physical, Logical, and several view schemas called subschemas.

A logical schema is most important in terms of its effect on application programs, as programmers construct apps by using logical schema.

Physical data independence, and physical schema change should not affect logical schema/application programs.

### Instance vs Schema

| Parameters | Schema in DBMS | Instance in DBMS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meaning | Schema refers to the overall description of any given database. | Instance basically refers to a collection of data and information that the database stores at any particular moment. |
| Alterations | The schema remains the same for the entire database as a whole. | One can change the instances of data and information in a database using updation, deletion, and addition. |
| Frequency of Change | It does not change very frequently. | It changes very frequently. |
| Uses | We use Schema for defining the basic structure of any given database. It defines how the available needs to get stored. | We use Instance for referring to a set of information at any given instance/ time. |

## Database Languages

**DDL (Data Definition Language) - Definition**

We specify consistency constraints, which must be checked, every time DB is updated.

```jsx
CREATE TABLE TABLE_NAME (DATATYPE VARIABLE, DATATYPE VARIABLE, DATATYPE VARIABLE); 
```

**DML (Data Modification Language)- Modification**

Data manipulation involves

1. Retrieval of information stored in DB.
2. Insertion of new information into DB.
3. Deletion of information from the DB.
4. Updating existing information stored in DB

The query language is a part of DML to specify the statement requesting the retrieval of information

```jsx
SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME;
```

### DDL vs DML

| Comparison Basis | DDL | DML |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basic | It helps us define a database's structure or schema and deals with how data is stored in the database. | It allows us to manipulate, i.e., retrieve, update, and delete the data stored in the database. |
| Full-Form | The full form of DDL is Data Definition Language. | The full form of DML is Data Manipulation Language. |
| Categorization | The DDL commands have no further classification. | The DML commands are classified as procedural and non-procedural (declarative) DMLs. |
| Command uses | The commonly used commands under DDL language are:
‚Ä¢ CREATE
‚Ä¢ DROP
‚Ä¢ ALTER
‚Ä¢ TRUNCATE
‚Ä¢ RENAME | The commonly used commands under DML language are:
‚Ä¢ INSERT
‚Ä¢ UPDATE
‚Ä¢ DELETE
‚Ä¢ SELECT |
| Auto-commit | DDL commands are auto-committed, so changes that happen in the database will be permanent. | DML commands are not auto-committed, so database changes are not permanent. |
| Rollback | DDL commands made changes permanent; therefore, we cannot roll back these statements. | DML commands do not make changes permanent; therefore, rollback is possible for these statements. |
| WHERE clause | DDL commands have no use of a WHERE clause because here, filtration of records is not possible. | The DML statements can use a WHERE clause while manipulating data in a database. |
| Effect | The DDL command affects the entire database or table. | The DML commands will affect the single or multiple records based on the specified condition. |

### How is the database accessed from Application Programs?

todo

### Database Administrator (DBA)

A person who has central control of both the data and the programs that access those data.

Functions of DBA:

1. Schema Definition
2. Storage structure and access methods.
3. Schema and physical organization modifications.
4. Authorization control.
5. Routine maintenance
    1. Periodic backups.
    2. Security patches.
    3. Any upgrades

## Database Application Architecture

**Database Architecture**¬†is a representation of DBMS design. It helps to design, develop, implement, and maintain the database management system. A DBMS architecture allows dividing the database system into individual components that can be independently modified, changed, replaced, and altered.

1. T1 Architecture:
    
    The client, server & DB are all present on the same machine.
    
    ![Untitled](DBMS%20d08f15f09268497080aa053f46430e84/Untitled%201.png)
    
2. T2 Architecture:
    
    The app is partitioned into 2-components. Client machine, which invokes DB system functionality at the server end through query language statements.
    
    API standards like ODBC & JDBC are used to interact between client and server.
    
    ![Untitled](DBMS%20d08f15f09268497080aa053f46430e84/Untitled%202.png)
    
3. T3 Architecture:
    
    The app is partitioned into 3 logical components.
    
    The client machine is just a front end and doesn‚Äôt contain any direct DB calls. It communicates with the App server, and the App server communicated with the `DB system to access data. Business logic, what action to take at that condition is in the App server itself.
    
    T3 architecture is best for WWW Applications.
    
    **Advantages:**
    
    - **Scalability:** due to distributed application servers.
    - **Data integrity:** The app server acts as a middle layer between the client and DB, which minimizes the chances of data corruption.
    - **Security:** the client can‚Äôt directly access DB, hence it is more secure

# Lecture 3: Entity-Relationship Model

### Data Models

Data Models are a collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints.

A¬†*data model*¬†is the hierarchy of memory classes that represent the data for the report application. It provides a way to describe the design of a DB at the logical level.

Underlying the structure of the DB is the Data Model; a collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics & consistency constraints

E.g., ER model, Relational Model, object-oriented model, object-relational data model, etc.

# ER Model

- ER model stands for an Entity-Relationship model. It is a high-level data model based on a perception of the real world that consists of a collection of basic objects, called
entities, and of relationships among these objects. This model is used to define the data elements and relationships for a specified system.
- It develops a conceptual design for the database. It also develops a very simple and easy-to-design view of data.
- In ER modeling, the database structure is portrayed as a diagram called an entity-relationship diagram.

### Entity

An Entity is a ‚Äúthing‚Äù or ‚Äúobject‚Äù in the real world that is distinguishable from all other objects. It has physical existence and can be uniquely defined.

**Strong Entity:** Can be uniquely identified. It is an¬†entity¬†type that has a key¬†attribute. It doesn't depend on other¬†entities¬†in the¬†[schema](https://www.scaler.com/topics/schema-in-dbms/). A strong¬†entity¬†always has a primary key, and it is represented by a single rectangle in the ER diagram.

**Weak Entity:** Can‚Äôt be uniquely identified. It depends on some other strong entity. It doesn‚Äôt have sufficient attributes, to select a uniquely identifiable attribute. A weak entity depends on a strong entity for existence. A weak entity is represented by a double-outlined rectangle in ER diagrams.

**Entity set:** It is a set of entities of the same type that share the same properties, or attributes.

### Attributes

Attributes are the characteristics or properties which define the entity type. In ER diagram, the attribute is represented by an oval.

Each entity has a value for each of its attributes. For each attribute, there is a set of permitted values, called the domain, or value set, of that attribute.

****************************************Types of Attributes:****************************************

1. **Simple attribute**: Attributes that cannot be further decomposed into sub-attributes are called simple attributes. It's an atomic value and is also known as the key attribute. Eclipse is used to represent an attribute. The underlined attribute is the key attribute.
    
    ![Untitled](DBMS%20d08f15f09268497080aa053f46430e84/Untitled%204.png)
    
2. **Composite attribute**: An attribute that is composed of many other¬†attributes¬†and can be decomposed into simple attributes is known as a¬†composite attribute in DBMS. The composite attribute is represented by an ellipse, and those ellipses are connected with an ellipse.
    
    ![Untitled](DBMS%20d08f15f09268497080aa053f46430e84/Untitled%205.png)
    
3. **Single-valued:** Single-valued attributes in DBMS¬†are attributes that can have only one value. Eclipse is used to represent an attribute. 
4. **Multivalued attribute**:¬†Multivalued attributes in DBMS¬†are attributes that can have more than one value. The double oval is used to represent multivalued attributes.
    
    ![Untitled](DBMS%20d08f15f09268497080aa053f46430e84/Untitled%206.png)
    
5. **Derived attribute**:¬†Derived attributes in DBMS¬†are the ones that can be derived from other attributes of an¬†entity¬†type. It can be represented by a dashed ellipse.
    
    ![Untitled](DBMS%20d08f15f09268497080aa053f46430e84/Untitled%207.png)
    

![Attributes of student entity](DBMS%20d08f15f09268497080aa053f46430e84/Untitled%208.png)

Attributes of student entity

### Null value

An attribute takes a null value when an entity does not have a value for it.

It may indicate ‚ÄúNot applicable‚Äù, When the value is unknown because it does not exist

It may indicate ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù, When a particular attribute does not apply to an entity;

It may indicate ‚ÄúNot known‚Äù, When the value of an attribute is unknown, although it exists;

### Relationships

A relationship is used to describe the relation between entities. A Diamond or rhombus is used to represent the relationship.

![Untitled](DBMS%20d08f15f09268497080aa053f46430e84/Untitled%209.png)

**Strong Relationship:** It is between two independent entities.

**Weak Relationship:** It is between a weak entity and its owner/strong entity.

Degree of Relationship (Number of entities participating in a relationship.):

1. Unary, Only one entity participates. e.g., Employee manages employee.
2. Binary, two entities participate. e.g., Student takes Course. (Binary are common)
3. Ternary relationship, three entities participate. E.g , Employee works-on branch, employee works-on job.

### Relationship constraints

Cardinality Ratio: The cardinality ratio for a binary relationship defines the maximum number of times a particular instance of an entity can be related to the instance of another entity.

- **One-to-One Relationship:** When only one instance of an entity is associated with the relationship, then it is known as one to one relationship.
    
    ![Untitled](DBMS%20d08f15f09268497080aa053f46430e84/Untitled%2010.png)
    
- **One-to-many relationship:** When only one instance of the entity on the left, and more than one instance of an entity on the right are associated with the relationship then this is known as a one-to-many relationship.
    
    ![Untitled](DBMS%20d08f15f09268497080aa053f46430e84/Untitled%2011.png)
    
- **Many-to-one relationship:** When more than one instance of the entity on the left, and only one instance of an entity on the right is associated with the relationship then it is known as a many-to-one relationship.
    
    ![Untitled](DBMS%20d08f15f09268497080aa053f46430e84/Untitled%2012.png)
    
- **Many-to-many relationship:** When more than one instance of the entity on the left, and more than one instance of an entity on the right are associated with the relationship then it is known as a many-to-many relationship.
    
    ![Untitled](DBMS%20d08f15f09268497080aa053f46430e84/Untitled%2013.png)
    

**Participation Constraint:**

Participation constraint specifies the existence of an entity when it is related to another entity in a relationship type. It is also called minimum cardinality constraint. This constraint specifies the number of instances of an entity that can participate in a relationship type.

- **Partial Participation:** In this not all entities are involved in the relationship instance.
- **Total Participation:** In this each entity must be involved in at least one relationship instance.

# Lecture 4

### Extended ER Features

****************************Specialization:****************************

Specialization is splitting up the entity set into further sub-entity sets on the basis of their functionalities, specialties, and features. 

It is a Top-Down approach.

e.g., the Person entity set can be divided into customer, student, and employee. The person is a superclass and other specialized entity sets are subclasses.

1. We have an ‚Äúis-a‚Äù relationship between the superclass and subclass.
2. Depicted by a triangle component

********Generalization:********

It is just a reverse of Specialization.

DB Designer may encounter certain properties of two entities that are overlapping. The designer may consider making a new generalized entity set. That generalized entity set will be a superclass. ‚Äúis-a‚Äù relationship is present between subclass and superclass.

Why Generalisation?

1. Makes DB more refined and simpler.
2. Common attributes are not repeated

**Attribute Inheritance**

1. Both Specialisation and Generalisation have attribute inheritance.
2. The attributes of higher-level entity sets are inherited by lower-level entity sets.
3. E.g., Customer & Employee inherit the attributes of Person.

**Participation Inheritance**

If a parent entity set participates in a relationship then its child entity sets will also participate in that relationship.

**Aggregation**

1. How to show relationships among relationships? - Aggregation is the technique.
2. Abstraction is applied to treat relationships as higher-level entities. We can call it an Abstract entity.
3. Avoid redundancy by aggregating relationships as an entity sets itself

# Lecture 5

### How to make/formulate an ER Diagram

1. Identify entity sets: any real word objects
2. Identify the attributes of the entity sets and their data types
3. Identify the relationships and their constraints (Mapping and participation)

# Lecture 7

The **Relational Model (RM)**¬†represents the database as a collection of relations. A relation is nothing but a table of values. Every row in the table represents a collection of related data values. These rows in the table denote a real-world entity or relationship.

A relational DB consists of a collection of tables, each of which is assigned a unique name.

### Relational Model Concepts

- **Relation:**¬†A two-dimensional table is used to store a collection of data elements.
- **Row / Record / Tuple:** It represents a relationship among a set of values, and the table is a collection of such relationships. A single row of the table represents a single data point / a unique record.
- **Column / Field / Attribute:** It represents the attributes of the relation. For each attribute, there is a permitted value, called the domain of the attribute.
- **Relation Schema:** It defines the design and structure of the relation, and contains the name of the relation and all the columns/attributes.
- **Degree of table:** number of attributes/columns in a given table/relation.
- **Cardinality:**¬†Total number of rows/tuples present in the Table/Relation.
- **Relation instance:** Relation instance is a finite set of tuples in the RDBMS system. Relation instances never have duplicate tuples.
- **Relational Key:** Set of attributes that can uniquely identify each tuple.
- **Attribute domain:** Every attribute has some pre-defined value and scope which is known as the attribute domain

### Properties of a table

1.  The name of the relation is distinct from all other relations.
2. The values have to be atomic. Can‚Äôt be broken down further.
3. The name of each attribute/column must be unique.
4. Each tuple must be unique in a table.
5. The sequence of rows and columns has no significance.
6. Tables must follow integrity constraints - it helps to maintain data consistency across the tables.

### Relational Model Keys

1. **Super Key (SK):** A super key is a set of attributes that can identify each tuple uniquely in the given relation. Any P&C of attributes present in a table that can uniquely identify each tuple.
2. **Candidate Key (CK):** A minimum subset of super keys, which can uniquely identify each tuple. It contains no redundant attribute. CK value shouldn‚Äôt be NULL.
3. **Primary Key (PK):** A primary key is a candidate key that the database designer selects while designing the database. It has the least number of attributes.
4. **Alternate Key (AK):** All CK except PK i.e. Candidate keys that are left unimplemented or unused after implementing the primary key are called as alternate keys.
5. **Foreign Key (FK):**  It creates a relation between two tables. A relation, say r1, may include among its attributes the PK of an other relation, say r2. This attribute is called FK from r1 referencing r2. The relation r1 is aka Referencing (Child) relation of the FK dependency, and r2 is called the Referenced (Parent) relation of the FK. FK helps to cross reference between two different relations.
6. **Composite Key:** A primary key comprising of multiple attributes and not just a single attribute is called as a composite key.
7. **Compound Key:** PK which is formed using 2 FK.
8. **Surrogate Key:** It is unique for all the records of the table. It is updatable. It can not be NULL i.e. it must have some value.
9. **Unique Key:** It is unique for all the records of the table. Once assigned, its value can not be changed i.e. it is non-updatable. It may have a NULL value.
10. **Partial Key:** Partial key is a key using which all the records of the table can not be identified uniquely. Same value for multiple tuples.

### ****Relational Integrity Constraints****

Relational Integrity constraints in DBMS are referred to conditions which must be present for a valid relation. These Relational constraints in DBMS are derived from the rules in the mini-world that the database represents.

1. Domain Constraints
    1. Restricts the value in the attribute of relation, specifies the Domain.
    2. Restrict the Data types of every attribute.
    3. E.g., We want to specify that the enrolment should happen for candidate birth year < 2002.
2. Entity Constraints: Every relation should have PK. PK != NULL
3. Referential Constraints
    1. Specified between two relations & helps maintain consistency among tuples of two relations.
    2. It requires that the value appearing in specified attributes of any tuple in the referencing relation also appear in the specified attributes of at least one tuple in the referenced relation.
    3. If FK in the referencing table refers to PK of a referenced table then every value of the FK in the referencing table must be NULL or available in the referenced table.
    4. FK must have the matching PK for each value in the parent table or it must be NULL.
4. Key Constraints: The six types of key constraints present in the Database management system are:-
    1. NOT NULL: This constraint will restrict the user from not having a NULL value. It ensures that every element in the database has a value.
    2. UNIQUE: It helps us to ensure that all the values consisting of a column are different from each other.
    3. DEFAULT: It is used to set the default value to the column. The default value is added to the columns if no value is specified for them.
    4. CHECK: It is one of the integrity constraints in DBMS. It keeps the check that the integrity of data is maintained before and after the completion of the CRUD.
    5. PRIMARY KEY: This is an attribute or set of attributes that can uniquely identify each entity in the entity set. The primary key must contain unique as well as not null values.
    6. FOREIGN KEY: Whenever there is some relationship between two entities, there must be some common attribute between them.
