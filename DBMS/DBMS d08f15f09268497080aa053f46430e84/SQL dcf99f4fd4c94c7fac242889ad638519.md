# SQL

SQL tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of SQL. Our SQL tutorial is designed for both beginners and professionals. It is used to perform operations on the records stored in the database, such as updating records, inserting records, deleting records, creating and modifying database tables, views, etc. It is not a database system, but it is a query language.

SQL uses CRUD operations to communicate with DB.

1. CREATE - execute INSERT statements to insert a new tuple into the relation.
2. READ - Read data already in the relations.
3. UPDATE - Modify already inserted data in the relation.
4. DELETE - Delete specific data point/tuple/row or multiple rows

### What is RDBMS

RDBMS stands for **Relational Database Management System**. RDBMS is a program used to maintain a relational database. RDBMS is the basis for all modern database systems such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and Microsoft Access. RDBMS uses SQL queries to access the data in the database.

MySQL uses a client-server model, where the client is CLI or frontend that uses services the MySQL server provides.

The difference between SQL and MySQL is that SQL is a Structured Query language used to perform CRUD operations in R-DB, while MySQL is an RDBMS used to

store, manage, and administrate DB (provided by itself) using SQL.

| DATATYPE | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CHAR | string(0-255), string with size = (0, 255], e.g., CHAR(251) |
| VARCHAR | string(0-255) |
| TINYTEXT | String(0-255) |
| TEXT | string(0-65535) |
| BLOB | string(0-65535) |
| MEDIUMTEXT | string(0-16777215) |
| MEDIUMBLOB | string(0-16777215) |
| LONGTEXT | string(0-4294967295) |
| LONGBLOB | string(0-4294967295) |
| TINYINT | integer(-128 to 127) |
| SMALLINT | integer(-32768 to 32767) |
| MEDIUMINT | integer(-8388608 to 8388607) |
| INT | integer(-2147483648 to 2147483647) |
| BIGINT | integer (-9223372036854775808 to
9223372036854775807) |
| FLOAT | Decimal with precision to 23 digits |
| DOUBLE | Decimal with 24 to 53 digits |
| DECIMAL | Double stored as a string |
| DATE | YYYY-MM-DD |
| DATETIME | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS |
| TIMESTAMP | YYYYMMDDHHMMSS |
| TIME | HH:MM:SS |
| ENUM | One of the preset values |
| SET | One or many of the preset values |
| BOOLEAN | 0/1 |
| BIT | e.g., BIT(n), n up to 64, store values in bits. |

Size: TINY < SMALL < MEDIUM < INT < BIGINT

Variable length Data types e.g., VARCHAR, are better to use as they occupy space equal to the actual data size. Values can also be unsigned e.g., INT UNSIGNED.

## Types of SQL Commands

### DDL:

DDL is a short name of Data Definition Language, which deals with database schemas and descriptions, of how the data should reside in the database.

- CREATE - to create a database and its objects like (table, index, views, store procedure, function, and triggers)
- ALTER - alters the structure of the existing database
- DROP - Delete objects from the database
- TRUNCATE - Remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records that are removed
- RENAME - rename an object

### DML:

DML is a short name for Data Manipulation Language which deals with data manipulation and includes most common SQL statements such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc., and it is used to store, modify, retrieve, delete and update data in a database. 

- SELECT - retrieve data from a database
- INSERT - Insert data into a table
- UPDATE - updates existing data within a table
- DELETE - Delete all records from a database table
- MERGE - UPSERT operation (insert or update)

### DCL:

DCL is a short name for Data Control Language which includes commands such as GRANT and is mostly concerned with rights, permissions and other controls of the database system.

- GRANT - allow users access privileges to the database
- REVOKE - Withdraw the user's access privileges given by using the GRANT command

### TCL:

TCL is a short name of Transaction Control Language which deals with a transaction within a database.

- START TRANSACTION: Begin a transaction
- COMMIT - commits a Transaction
- ROLLBACK - rollback a transaction in case of any error occurs
- SAVEPOINT - to roll back the transaction making points within groups

## SQL Commands

## DDL (Create, Drop, Show)

1.  CREATE DATABASE: The CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a new SQL database.
    
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE database_name;
    ```
    
2.  DROP DATABASE: The DROP DATABASE statement is used to drop an existing SQL database.
    
    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE database_name;
    ```
    
3. CREATE TABLE: The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database.
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE table_name (
    	column1 datatype,
    	column2 datatype,
    	column3 datatype,
    	....
    );
    ```
    
4. DROP TABLE: The DROP TABLE statement is used to drop an existing table in a database.
    
    ```sql
    DROP TABLE table_name;
    ```
    
5. TRUNCATE TABLE: The TRUNCATE TABLE statement is used to delete the data inside a table, but not the table itself.
    
    ```sql
    TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
    ```
    
6. ALTER TABLE: The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table. The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.
    
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE table_name
    	ADD column_name datatype;
    ```
    
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE table_name
    	DROP COLUMN column_name;
    ```
    
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE table_name
    	MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype;
    ```
    
7. SHOW DATABASES: list all the DBs in the server.
    
    ```sql
    SHOW DATABASES;
    ```
    
8. SHOW TABLES: List tables in the selected DB.
    
    ```sql
    SHOW TABLES;
    ```
    

## DDL Constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique, Check, Default, Alter Options)

1. Primary Key Constraint
    
    It is not null, unique, and only one per table
    
    It is a good practice to define it in ‘int’ datatype.
    
2. Foreign Key Constraint
    
    FK refers to the PK of other tables. Each relation can have any number of FK
    
3. UNIQUE Constraint
    
    Unique, can be null, a table can have multiple unique attributes
    
4. CHECK Constraint
    
    It is a consistency constraint
    
    Once defined when creating a table, it checks for the conditions for every input
    
    ```sql
    	CONSTRAINT constraint_name CHECK(condition);
    ```
    
5. DEFAULT Constraint
    
    Set the default value of the column
    
    The default value can be set for a column when defining a table
    
    ```sql
    column_name DATATYPE DEFAULT value; 
    ```
    
6. ALTER Operations
    
    It is used for the changes to be made in the schema or table after it is created.
    
    1. ADD
        
        Add a new column.
        
        ```sql
        ALTER TABLE table_name
        ADD column_name datatype;
        ```
        
    2. MODIFY
        
        Change the datatype of an attribute.
        
        ```sql
        ALTER TABLE table_name
        MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype;
        ```
        
    3. CHANGE COLUMN
        
        Rename column name.
        
        ```sql
        ALTER TABLE table-name 
        CHANGE COLUMN old-col-name new-col-name new-col-datatype;
        ```
        
    4. DROP COLUMN
        
        Drop a column completely
        
        ```sql
        ALTER TABLE table-name
        DROP COLUMN col-name;
        ```
        
    5. RENAME
        
        Rename the table name itself
        
        ```sql
        ALTER TABLE table-name
        RENAME TO new-table-name;
        ```
        

## DRL (Select, Where, Between, In, And, Or, Not, Null, Order By, Group By, Having)

1. SELECT: The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name;
    ```
    
    Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from. If you want to select all the fields available in the table, use the following syntax: 
    
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM table_name;
    ```
    
2. SELECT DISTINCT: The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name;
    ```
    
3. SELECT TOP: The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
    ```
    
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
    LIMIT number;
    ```
    
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    ORDER BY column_name(s)
    FETCH FIRST number ROWS ONLY;
    ```
    
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE ROWNUM <= number;
    ```
    
    In case the interviewer asks other than the TOP, the rest are also correct. (Diff. DB Systems)
    
4. WHERE: The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
    ```
    
    | Operator  | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | =  | Equal |
    | >  | Greater than |
    | <  | Less than |
    | >=  | Greater than or equal |
    | <=  | Less than or equal |
    | <>  | Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as != |
5. BETWEEN: The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates. The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
    ```
    
6. IN: The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause. The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
    ```
    
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE column_name IN (SELECT STATEMENT);
    ```
    
7. AND, OR, and NOT: The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.
    
    The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:
    
    - The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.
    - The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
    
    The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;
    ```
    
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;
    ```
    
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE NOT condition;
    ```
    
8. NULL Value: It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>. We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT column_names
    FROM table_name
    WHERE column_name IS NULL;
    ```
    
    ```sql
    SELECT column_names
    FROM table_name
    WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
    ```
    
9. ORDER BY: The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order. The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
    ```
    
10. GROUP BY: The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
    
    The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
    GROUP BY column_name(s)
    ORDER BY column_name(s);
    ```
    
11.  HAVING: The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.
    
    WHERE is given priority over HAVING.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
    GROUP BY column_name(s)
    HAVING condition
    ORDER BY column_name(s);
    ```
    
    - WHERE vs HAVING
        1. Both have same function of filtering the row base on certain conditions.
        2. WHERE clause is used to filter the rows from the table based on specified condition
        3. HAVING clause is used to filter the rows from the groups based on the specified condition.
        4. HAVING is used after GROUP BY while WHERE is used before GROUP BY clause.
        5. If you are using HAVING, GROUP BY is necessary.
        6. WHERE can be used with SELECT, UPDATE & DELETE keywords while GROUP BY used with SELECT
12. Pattern Searching / Wildcard Matching (’%’,’_’ )
    - ‘%’, any number of character from 0 to n. Similar to ‘*’ asterisk in regex.
    - ‘_’, only one character.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM customer WHERE name LIKE '%p_';
    # This searches for a name whose second last character is p, % denotes any number of char before p and _ is one char after p
    ```
    
13.  WHERE vs HAVING
    1. Both have the same function of filtering the row based on certain conditions.
    2. WHERE clause is used to filter the rows from the table based on specified condition
    3. The HAVING clause is used to filter the rows from the groups based on the specified condition.
    4. HAVING is used after GROUP BY while WHERE is used before GROUP BY clause.
    5. If you are using HAVING, GROUP BY is necessary.
    6. WHERE can be used with SELECT, UPDATE & DELETE keywords while GROUP BY used with SELECT

## DML (Insert, Update, Delete, Replace)

1. INSERT INTO: The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.
    
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
    VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
    ```
    
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO table_name
    VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
    ```
    
    In the second syntax, make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table.
    
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO table_name (column1. column2)
    VALUES (value1, value2);
    ```
    
    In the third syntax, only the column specified will be affected and others will be assigned the default value, if no default value is provided then null. 
    
2. UPDATE: The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.
    
    ```sql
    UPDATE table_name
    SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
    WHERE condition;
    ```
    
    ```sql
    -- to update multiple rows
    SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0; -- this should be run so as to diable safe mode and bulk changes can be made, it is blocked my MySQL as a safety feature.
    UPDATE table_name
    SET column1 = new_value;
    ```
    
    ON UPDATE CASCADE
    
    Can be added to the table while creating constraints. Suppose there is a situation where we have two tables such that primary key of one table is the foreign key for another table. if we update the primary key of the first  table then using the ON UPDATE CASCADE foreign key of the second table automatically get updated.
    
3. DELETE: The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.
    
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
    ```
    
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM table_name;
    ```
    
    In the 2nd syntax, all rows are deleted. The table structure, attributes, and indexes will be intact
    
    ON DELETE CASCADE - (to overcome DELETE constraint of Referential constraints), it is written after the foreign key sentence in the table declaration. It means that when a row is deleted and its ID is linked to some other table via a foreign key, each and every linked data will be deleted,
    
    ON DELETE NULL - (can FK have null values?), it is written after the foreign key sentence in the table declaration. It means that when a row is deleted and its ID is linked to some other table via a foreign key, each and every linked data will be changed to null,
    
4. REPLACE:  Primarily used for already present tuples in a table. Works as UPDATE, using REPLACE with the help of the WHERE clause in PK, then that row will be replaced. Works as INSERT, if there is no duplicate data new tuple will be inserted.
    
    ```sql
    REPLACE INTO table_name (primary_key, column)
    VALUES(value1, value2);
    ```
    
    ```sql
    REPLACE INTO table_name
    SET col1 = val1, col2 = val2;
    ```
    
    ```sql
    REPLACE INTO table_name (column1, column2)
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name WHERE value = value1; -- for the primary key to uniquely identify the row to replace
    ```
    

DESC table_name : used to describe the table, it displays all the details about the table.

## JOINS

**SQL Join** statement is used to combine data or rows from two or more tables based on a common field between them. All RDBMS are relational in nature, we refer to other tables to get meaningful outcomes. FK are used to do reference to other table.

### Alias in MySQL (AS)

Aliases in MySQL is used to give a temporary name to a table or a column in a table for the purpose of a particular query. It works as a nickname for expressing the tables or column names. It makes the query short and neat.

```sql
SELECT col_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;

```

```sql
SELECT col_name1, col_name2,...
FROM table_name AS alias_name;
```

### INNER JOIN

Returns a resultant table that has matching values from both the tables or all the tables.

```sql
SELECT column-list FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON condition1
INNER JOIN table3 ON condition2
…;
```

![Untitled](SQL%20dcf99f4fd4c94c7fac242889ad638519/Untitled.png)

### LEFT JOIN (OUTER JOIN)

This returns a resulting table that all the data from the left table and the matched data from the right table.

```sql
SELECT columns FROM table 
LEFT JOIN table2 
ON Join_Condition;
```

![Untitled](SQL%20dcf99f4fd4c94c7fac242889ad638519/Untitled%201.png)

### RIGHT JOIN (OUTER JOIN)

This returns a resulting table that all the data from the right table and the matched data from the left table.

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON join_cond;
```

![Untitled](SQL%20dcf99f4fd4c94c7fac242889ad638519/Untitled%202.png)

### FULL JOIN (OUTER JOIN)

This returns a resulting table that contains all data when there is a match on left or right table data.

Emulated in MySQL using LEFT and RIGHT JOIN.

LEFT JOIN UNION RIGHT JOIN.

```sql
SELECT columns FROM table1 as t1 LEFT JOIN table2 as t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
UNION
SELECT columns FROM table1 as t1 RIGHT JOIN table2 as t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;
```

![Untitled](SQL%20dcf99f4fd4c94c7fac242889ad638519/Untitled%203.png)

### CROSS JOIN

This returns all the cartesian products of the data present in both tables. Hence, all possible variations are reflected in the output.

Used rarely for practical purposes.

Table 1 has 10 rows and Table 2 has 5, then resultant would have 50 rows.

```sql
SELECT column-lists
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

![Untitled](SQL%20dcf99f4fd4c94c7fac242889ad638519/Untitled%204.png)

### SELF JOIN

It is used to get the output from a particular table when the same table is joined to itself. Used very less. Emulated using INNER JOIN

```sql
SELECT columns FROM table as t1
INNER JOIN table as t2
ON t1.id = t2.id;
```

### Join without using join keywords.

We eliminate the use of the join keyword and it is handled by MySQL itself.

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1, table2
WHERE condition;
```

### SOME MORE JOINS

![Untitled](SQL%20dcf99f4fd4c94c7fac242889ad638519/Untitled%207.png)

## SET OPERATIONS

Used to combine multiple select statements. Always gives distinct rows.

### UNION

Combines two or more SELECT statements.

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1
UNION
SELECT * FROM table2;
```

Number of column, order of column must be same for table1 and table2.

### INTERSECT

Returns common values of the tables. It is Emulated as this is not present in MySQL.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column-list
FROM table-1
INNER JOIN table-2
USING(join_cond);
```

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT * 
FROM table1 
INNER JOIN table2 
ON USING(id);
```

### MINUS

This operator returns the distinct row from the first table that does not occur in the second table. It is Emulated as this is not present in MySQL.

```sql
SELECT column_list 
FROM table1 
LEFT JOIN table2 ON condition 
WHERE table2.column_name IS NULL;
```

```sql
SELECT id 
FROM table-1 
LEFT JOIN table-2 
USING(id) 
WHERE table-2.id IS NULL;
```

### JOINS VS SET OPERATIONS

| JOIN | SET Operations |
| --- | --- |
| Combines multiple tables based on matchingcondition. | Combination is resulting set from two or moreSELECT statements |
| Column wise combination | Row wise combination |
| Data types of two tables can be different.  | Datatypes of corresponding columns from eachtable should be the same |
| Can generate both distinct or duplicate rows. | Generate distinct rows |
| The number of column(s) selected may or may notbe the same from each table | The number of column(s) selected must be thesame from each table |
| Combines results horizontally | Combines results vertically. |
